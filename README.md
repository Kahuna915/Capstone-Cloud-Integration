# Capstone-Cloud Integration

## Executive Overview:

Welcome to the Capstone Wiki. In this project we have worked on implementing a cloud component to Champlain College. The integration of AWS into cyber.local to create one spot where user accounts, networks and billing are all centrally managed is fascinating. I reached out to Professor Adam Goldstein upon hearing about this and began asking questions. Growing up I have been very much intrigued in the Cloud because I believe that is the direction that the industry is moving. Everything will end up in the cloud at some point and so for our capstone, I wanted to explore/familiarize myself with it. I want to help to create an easier life for the faculty at Champlain College for all they have done for me. I believe the way forward is by moving the creation of user accounts, network managing, and all billing to the cloud is the way forward. My goal would be to first get familiarized with how AWS handles any service. From, here I would like to get a simple Active Directory with a few VPCs and work my way up to connecting to an on premise active directory. Through this I would want numerous scripts to automate all user creation and group formation process. Finally, I want to look at billing and create systems and a proper chain to set limitations on the environment. The problems I have identified is what our group set out to solve. Although this project is not going into production. We hope our research will be the basis for Champlain's great transition to the cloud. 

## Abstract

In the fast paced world we live in today computer access is extremely important for not just individuals but companies in general. But as one might know since the pandemic started access to switch's, servers, firewalls is very limited. I had spoke to Dell a few weeks ago and they told me a SWITCH would take 295 days to be shipped out due to lack of parts. This lack of availability has led to the integration of environments in the cloud. And for a smaller school we should be giving our students the best/most up to date technology. I believe setting up a cloud environment for cyber.local for my capstone will be extremely useful. It allows students another playground to train themselves.

## Problem/Research Statement

Computer resources are limited and rapidly changing. On premise devices that you buy today will be out of date within a few years. They will still function but why do we continue to order parts and be on the long waiting list. There's two problems here which is the availability of resources and affordability. The cloud is expensive if your not using it but is much more beneficial then paying for space for a server room, setting up all the wiring, and having to fix any issues that arise. Cloud allows the migration from on premise resources to cloud based infrastructure in time.

## Purpose statement

The purpose of this capstone is for me and my team to understand how the cloud works. We all find the cloud absolutely fascinating and I strongly believe its a new technology that is world changing and has the potential to be altered slightly and improve life for many around the world. My hope is we can setup cyber.local but if not I believe the experience of working within a cloud and having this baseline setup is invaluable knowledge.
